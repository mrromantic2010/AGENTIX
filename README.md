- **Agentic Framework**
- **Agents**
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Graphiti**
- **Knowledge Graph**
- **Large Language Models (LLM)**
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- **Python**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Temporal AI**

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable components to suit your needs.
- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with existing Python libraries.
- **Graphiti Support**: Leverage knowledge graphs for enhanced data representation.
- **MCP Integration**: Use Model Context Protocol for context-aware interactions.
- **RAG Capabilities**: Improve agent responses with retrieval-augmented generation.

## Getting Started

After installation, you can create your first AI agent. Here's a simple example:

```python
from agentix import Agent

class MyAgent(Agent):
    def act(self, input_data):
        # Your logic here
        return "Hello, I am your agent!"

agent = MyAgent()
response = agent.act("What can you do?")
print(response)
```

### Running Your Agent

You can run your agent by executing the main script:

```bash
python my_agent.py
```
